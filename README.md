# Proprioception-Project
A new repository for analytical notebooks related to my ongoing proprioception project. So far, there are 6 datasets of mouse proprioceptor neurons, with more on the way. For each dataset, a pipeline has been fitted and customized. To be able to work on all of these notebooks contemporaneously, and avoid having to make new copies: Version control.
